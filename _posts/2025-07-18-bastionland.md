- I finally got my physical copy of Mythic Bastionland in that mail and it's
  fantastic. This book has been on my mind since September of last year when a
  friend showed it to me for the first time. I was originally pretty skeptical
  because I had never played an OSR game before and my only experience was with
  games like 5e, Blades in the Dark, and other more modern games. My biggest
  hang up was character progression. It felt like it must get boring after a few
  sessions when you don't get cool new spells or feats that you can use in
  combat. I was very wrong.

- Emily is nearly four months old at this point. She's a much easier baby than
  Dean was, or we are just more seasoned parents. I had such expectations that
  it was going to be crazy jumping from one kid to two and our lives were
  basically going to be over, but that just hasn't been the case.

- I've been saving up money for the last few months to get a Surly Disc Trucker
  bike. When Emily was born I watched the series "Tip to Tip" by Ludwig and
  Micheal Reeves and it had such a profound impact on me. Since I have zero
  desire to get a motorcycle, I started looking into doing long distance cycling
  and found out that there are bikes designed for this task. While I do love my
  current bike, I can confidently say it's certainly not as comfortable as it
  once was. In high school I didn't mind so much leaning over into the drops and
  clipping into the pedals. Now, I would rather a more comfortable experience
  and just throw on my tennis shoes.

- Game dev is cruising along. Spatial partition has been implemented and is
  currently being debugged. I am still working alongside the handmade hero
  videos, but I am starting to feel more and more confident in branching off and
  doing my own thing. There are a few ideas and strategies that I am not
  familiar with that I would prefer to get some insight on, but the days are
  numbered for Handmade Hero.
