Not much gamedev progress in the last week, it's been a bit hectic since I'm
starting a new job. I have spent some time updating my knowledge-base though and
thought it would be interesting to write about.

I have a notes site at [kb.maladroit.dev](https://kb.maladroit.dev) that is
GitHub pages site consisting of all my notes I have taken in the last few years.
This repository was originally created for keeping my notes in Obsidian, but
after a few months of that I realized I just preferred markdown instead. Some
annoying hurdles to deal with were Jekyll not supporting mermaid tables, how to
manage subdomains with Github, reorganizing all my notes to play nicer with
jekyll, and getting a search bar working. All of which were easily fixed with a
mixture of coffee, stack overflow, and swearing.

The outlook for gamedev progress doesn't look promising next week since I'll
likely be doing a lot of onboarding, but who knows. Maybe I'll still have the
energy at the end of the day to look at some variable frequency sine waves.
