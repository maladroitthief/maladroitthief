I have been trying to figure out new ways to encourage studying. I have been
finding it exceptionally difficult recently to read/study because life has been
chaotic. The dog needs played with, Dean wants to play outside, and honestly
some days I am just not motivated enough to read about some new software design
technique. My latest attempt at removing friction to study is annotating PDFs in
GoodNotes with the intent to refine those notes into the KB. Time will tell if
that actually works or if it's another strategy that just doesn't stick.

Thanks to some friendly people on the Zig discord server, I figured out why my
allocations were not working as I expected. I also worked out how to get one
large block of virtual memory that I can partition out with some fancy pointer
arithmetic which is something I have not thought about since college. Still
powering through gamedev in Zig and honestly it won't be too long until I pass
where I had got in Go. Handmade Hero has been a tremendous help with
demonstrating how to organize the code for a game.

I also got a new pencil this week that I am very pleased with. The rotring 600
0.5mm mechanical pencil has been very impressive so far. I wasn't disappointed
with the Kaweco SketchUp 5.6mm, but I was looking for something to do very
detailed technical writing/drawing. My guess is the SketchUp will end up being
my ttrpg writer and the 600 will be mostly for technical notes and design. I
think my writing tool journey is finally at a close, but I had that same thought
when I got the Lamy 2000...
