The last year was a pretty great year for music. From familiar favorites like
King Gizzard, IDLES, and Jack White to artists brand new to me like Baker Boy,
The Lemon Twigs, and Magdalena Bay. It was just a phenomenal year for albums and
it was really difficult picking just one for my album of the year. I was stuck
for the longest time on King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard's "b741" and Bring Me
The Horizon's "POST HUMAN: NeX GEn" and kept flip flopping between which I liked
more. Thankfully, the burden of choosing was removed when another album came out
that was so remarkable it made the decision effortless.

## Geordie Greep - The New Sound

This album not only sounds incredible and stays interesting after multiple
listens, but the lyrical content is so intriguing I kept finding new things
after multiple listens. Exploring subjects like toxic masculinity, delusions of
grandeur, and what I can only describe as "White Knight Syndrome", the album is
uncomfortable, compelling, and demands attention otherwise you might miss out on
the narrative. My favorite track is the As If Waltz, and honestly I am not sure
I have a least favorite track. It's disappointing that Black Midi has split up,
but if that means that Geordie Greep is going to be producing more content like
this then maybe it's a change that needed to happen. I highly recommend giving
this album a listen and then another dozen or so listens after that.

Some other albums worth mentioning that were potentially in the running:

- King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - b741
- Bring Me The Horizon - POST HUMAN: NeX GEn
- Knocked Loose - You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To
- Magdalena Bay - Imaginal Disk
- Cheekface - It's Sorted
