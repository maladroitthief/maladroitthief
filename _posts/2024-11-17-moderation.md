I have been trying to be more disciplined about different aspects of my life
recently. I have started intermittent fasting again to try and fit into my nicer
dress clothes that I haven't worn in years. I have also setup the app ScreenZen
to moderate my YouTube usage on my phone. I used to average between 4-5 hours a
day which has now been cut down to just about an hour. Not too shabby.

I think I am finished with the controller/keyboard code. I still need to work
out how to rebind keys as they are hard-coded right now, but that can be future
Ian's problem. I was thinking today about having the BPM of the game's
soundtrack be influenced by the difficulty. On easier difficulties the music
could be more relaxed while when playing a harder difficulty would be something
like breakcore. I'm still undecided about which direction I should take for the
game as well. I feel like the randomly generated level design has been over done
at this point and it would be cool to have a game with a static and thoughtful
level design but still roguelike mechanics. There could be some random elements
like hidden rooms that vary from run to run and the boss rewards being random,
but the world layout would remain constant. Maybe even the world evolves run
after run, but in a predictable way. Similar to unlocking the Horsemen in Isaac.
