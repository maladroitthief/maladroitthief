A lot has changed in the last few months. My daughter Emily was born on March 22
and she's pretty great. Paternity leave came and went in what felt like no time
at all. Now I am back on the grind and trying to cut back on my phone usage
entirely. While in the hospital, I watch Ludwig and Michael Reeves attempt to
cross Japan with no map or smart phone in 14 days on YouTube. It left such
a powerful impact on me that I have been working on trying to forgo using my
phone entirely. I still use it for music and texting, but I am leaving it at the
house more and more when I go out and favoring my pocket notebook instead.
