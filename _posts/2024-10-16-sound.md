Nothing quite as sobering as taking a 440 hz square wave right to the dome.
After fiddling for just over an hour by adjusting the volume, frequency, period,
and reading the new SDL3 documentation, I realized that I didn't have my
AudioStream bound to any AudioDevice.

```zig
fn SDLInitAudio() !void {
    const srcSpec = c.SDL_AudioSpec{
        .format = c.SDL_AUDIO_S16,
        .channels = 1,
        .freq = 48000,
    };
    const dstSpec = c.SDL_AudioSpec{
        .format = c.SDL_AUDIO_F32,
        .channels = 2,
        .freq = 48000,
    };

    const audioDeviceId = c.SDL_OpenAudioDevice(c.SDL_AUDIO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_PLAYBACK, &dstSpec);
    if (audioDeviceId == 0) {
        c.SDL_LogError(c.SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION, "%s", c.SDL_GetError());
        return error.SDLOpenAudioDevice;
    }

    audioStream = c.SDL_CreateAudioStream(&srcSpec, &dstSpec);
    if (audioStream == null) {
        c.SDL_LogError(c.SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION, "%s", c.SDL_GetError());
        return error.SDLCreateAudioStream;
    }

    const success = c.SDL_BindAudioStream(audioDeviceId, audioStream);
    if (!success) {
        c.SDL_LogError(c.SDL_LOG_CATEGORY_APPLICATION, "%s", c.SDL_GetError());
        return error.SDLBindAudioStream;
    }
}
```

Now that I have the volume lowered from 30k to 2k, I now have keyboard, gamepad,
video, and sound all working for SDL3 using Zig by following alongside Casey
Muratori's Handmade Hero series.

I'm also going to _try_ blogging this process as much as I can. It's been ages
since I have had to write paragraphs of just my rambling, but it could be
valuable for future Ian as well as anyone else foolish enough to try making a
video game over the course of a decade. My goal for right now is to chuck a few
paragraphs into this once a week chronicling my progress.
